# Simulator-for-LTI-SISO-Systems-
This is a simulator for LTI systems with single i/p and single o/p implemented using python

1 - Required:  
Designing a GUI application to visualize and simulate LTI systems with single input and single output

2 - System simulation and model:
The GUI allows the user to enter the output and input orders, to choose the input signal type, to specify a maximum time interval for 
the plotting, to enter the parameters of the output and the input or to randomize their values, 
and to plot the output or the state responses for different types of inputs.

3 - Methods and algorithms used in solving:
State-space representation:
I used the controllable canonical form method to convert the i/o differential equation to its state-space representation. 
For a general nth-order transfer function 
The system parameters can either be generated randomly or be taken as inputs from the user.

4 - Numerical approximations and simulations algorithms:
Block Method for Solving  State-Space Equations of Linear Continuous-Time Control systems.
This algorithm can find the numerical solution of nth-order state-space equations for linear time-invariant systems. 
The block method principle is basically a cycle of extrapolation and has the benefit of being self-initiating.
